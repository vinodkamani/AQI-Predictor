# 🌍 Global AQI Predictor — Pearls Virtual Internship

A fully automated, serverless Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction system that collects live pollution data every hour, trains a machine learning model daily, and displays a 3-day forecast for any city in the world on an interactive web dashboard.

**🔗 Live Dashboard:** https://aqi-predictor-mhn5gfhw3wxatuccku7js8.streamlit.app/

## 📌 Project Overview

Air pollution is a serious public health issue in cities like Karachi and across the world. This system solves the problem of not knowing how air quality will change in the coming days by providing an automated 3-day AQI forecast using real pollution data and machine learning — for any city in the world.

## ⚙️ Automated Pipeline

Two GitHub Actions workflows run automatically:

- **Feature Pipeline** — runs every hour, fetches fresh AQI data, saves to CSV
- **Training Pipeline** — runs every day at 2AM UTC, retrains model with latest data

The system updates itself with zero manual effort.
